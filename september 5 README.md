Autonomous Robots as Performing Agents.
In the article, Karl R. Wurst and Robert McCartney describe the research on developing physical implementations of performing agents, or "puppots." The goal is to have these puppots entertain an audience through their performances. The authors discuss the need for communication between the puppots and other agents and between the puppots and an external director. They also describe the difficulties involved in implementing this communication in a physical form.
The authors argue that robots have several advantages as performing agents. First, robots are capable of performing physical tasks that would be difficult or impossible for humans to perform. For example, a robot could perform acrobatics or other physical feats that would be difficult for a human to perform. Second, robots can be programmed to repeat actions exactly, which means they can perform a task consistently and safely. This is a significant advantage, as it means that robots can be used to perform tasks that require a high degree of precision, such as surgery. I agree that robots can be designed to exhibit natural characteristics, such as facial expressions and body language. This means that they can be used to create a more lifelike and engaging performance.
In conclusion, the authors do a great job discussing the potential for robots to serve as performing agents. However, some challenges still need to be addressed for this to become a reality. For example, robots need to become more sophisticated in their ability to interact with humans. They also need to be able to adapt to different situations and environments. Additionally, the cost of robots needs to be lowered to be more accessible to a broader range of people and organizations.
