The article suggests that robots should be designed to have continuous internal processes, like humans, in order to create more natural and fluent interactions. Additionally, robots should be responsive to human actions and inputs rather than simply reacting. This could be achieved by using perceptual or physical priming or having the robot act quickly and based on partial information. I agree with the article's overall premise. I think humans are more likely to accept and interact fluently with robots if the robots are designed to have continuous internal processes.
 Additionally, responsiveness is key for human-robot interaction. Quick and intuitive responses can help create a more natural flow of interaction. By doing this, the robot would be able to maintain a continuous internal process and be more responsive to humans. I think some challenges need to be addressed to implement these ideas effectively. For example, how would a robot be able to maintain a continuous internal process?
In conclusion, it is amazing how robots are becoming increasingly involved in the performing arts. I think it is great that they are able to add an element of fun and excitement to these shows. I also believe it is important to note that these robots are not just there for entertainment value, but they also have the potential to teach people about the performing arts. Additionally, robots can be programmed to repeat the same actions repeatedly, which would be perfect for a dance or other type of performance where choreography is important. In my opinion, robots could be a great addition to the world of performance. They would add a new element that would be both unique and exciting. I would be interested to see how audiences react to robot performance. I think that it would be an exciting and different experience.
